# 🐱 Cat Photo App
I completed my *first project* of a course I'm taking on freeCodeCamp [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).
It is a fully responsive and simple webpage built with HTML that displays, cat photos, some information about them and a short form.
## What I practiced with the Cat Photo App:
* ✔️Basic HTML structure(headings, body, pararaphs, links, lists).
* ✔️Adding images with 'src' and 'alt' attributes.
* ✔️How to use different types of elements for specific purposes(img element, anchor element,figure element, em element, e.t.c.).
* ✔️Creating forms with input, radio buttons, checkboxes, the fieldset element).
* ✔️ Using 'type', 'id', 'name', and 'value' attributes correctly.
* ✔️Indicating required fields in a form with the required element.
* ✔️Enhancing accessibility with the label element and the for attribute.
* ✔️Semantic HTML with elements such as section, header, footer and main.

## What I learned:
* How to structure a page with semantic elements and how important this is.
* How to properly nest elements in one element(move two spaces to the right).
* The importance of specifying the kind of action a button is to perform.
* The difference between 'id' and 'value' attribute and why they should be set to the same values.
* How orm inputs send 'name=value' pairs when submitted.
* Why radio buttons and checkboxes need the 'value' attribute.
## 📝Next Steps
* Completing the next project in the course I'm taking(*cafe menu*).
* Gradually completing the course and earning a certificate.
* Continuous building and uploading my proojects to GitHub.
